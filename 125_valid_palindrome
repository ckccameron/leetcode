# after research, Ruby has gsub method aka global substitution method that can use regex expression to susbtitute all characters of a string provided specific parameters
# by setting a range of all lowercase letters from a to z as well as all uppercase letters from A to Z, we can delete and replace with a blank/empty string
# downcasing all the letters allows for A and a to match up, for example, as long as the given input string reads the same forward and backward -> ex. Level
# since the method is returning a true/false boolean output, set s to be exactly equal to s reversed to determine whether input string is valid palindrome
