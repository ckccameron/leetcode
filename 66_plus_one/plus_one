# since the digits are input into an array with commas separating them, join the digits and convert to integer to make it a data type that math can be applied to
# add 1 to the converted integer
# set a result array placeholder
# set the integer to a string so that each character/digit can be manipulated individually and subsequently appended to the result array as an integer
# this handles instances where the last digit of the array is increased by 1 (ex. [1,2,3]), and also handles instances where a new leading digit is needed (ex. [9])
